// noteSimilarity — deterministic copy-forward / repetitive-documentation review.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// Cloned notes are one of the top ADR and denial triggers in home health: an
// episode where every visit reads identically cannot show visit-specific skilled
// need, and reviewers treat it as unsupported care. `visitComparison.js` already
// compares VITALS across visits; nothing compared the TEXT.
//
// TONE IS A REQUIREMENT, NOT A PREFERENCE
// This engine is ADVISORY and must never accuse anyone of fraud or cloning. Home
// health notes on a stable patient are legitimately similar — the same wound,
// the same teaching topic, the same homebound rationale. The finding is always
// "high similarity to prior documentation — review for visit-specific detail",
// never a misconduct claim, and it NEVER blocks a save.
//
// DETERMINISTIC BY DESIGN
// No LLM. Shingled Jaccard similarity plus exact repeated-sentence detection,
// both reproducible from the same inputs, so a nurse who asks "why was I
// flagged?" gets the same answer every time and can see the exact repeated text.
//
// Pure + offline so it runs under `node --test`. It may only import other plain
// `.js` modules with explicit extensions (never `.jsx`).
