/**
 * The standing scope statement for every OASIS surface.
 *
 * PennSync is NOT the official OASIS completion or submission system — the
 * agency completes and submits OASIS in its EMR / iQIES. PennSync reviews,
 * explains and cross-checks what staff entered there. This notice is deliberately
 * always visible rather than tucked behind a disclosure: it is the sentence that
 * stops the OASIS Center reading as the official assessment.
 *
 * It also states the version PennSync's guidance is patterned after, that
 * PennSync's internal item set is abbreviated, and how much of that set a
 * qualified OASIS reviewer has actually signed off — so no one mistakes a
 * screening question for the CMS instrument, and the sign-off gap is visible
 * in the product rather than only in a document.
