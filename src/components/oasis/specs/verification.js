// Per-item verification registry for PennSync's internal OASIS screening set.
//
// THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES
// An audit of `oasisQuestions.jsx` on 2026-08-31 found items presenting official
// CMS item numbers with content that does not belong to those items, and items
// whose response lists are shortened versions of the official response sets. A
// nurse reading "M2200 — Speech-Language Pathology" could carry that item number
// into the official assessment. The repository even contradicted itself:
// `AIProactiveOASISAssistant.jsx` describes M2102 as "Types and Sources of
// Assistance" while `oasisQuestions.jsx` labelled it "Physical Therapy".
//
// THE FIX, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY IS NOT
// PennSync does not hold the authoritative CMS instrument, so this registry does
// NOT invent correct titles or response sets — that would replace one fabrication
// with another. It records, per item, WHAT PENNSYNC KNOWS:
//
//   verified            — title and response set confirmed against a CMS source.
//   abbreviated         — a real CMS item, but PennSync's response list is a
//                         SHORTENED screening version. Usable to prompt a review;
//                         never usable as the official response set.
//   unverified          — a real CMS item number whose PennSync wording has not
//                         been confirmed against a CMS source.
//   pennsync_screening  — NOT a CMS item. A PennSync-internal screening question.
//                         It must never display an official item number.
//
// Nothing here is graded by an LLM. The classification is data and the UI
// consequences are deterministic.
//
// SOURCE CHECK (2026-09-01) — WHAT IT FOUND
// The item numbers below were checked against the published CMS manuals:
//   OASIS-E  (Updated 01/01/2024) https://www.cms.gov/files/document/oasis-emanual2024-update.pdf
//   OASIS-E1 (Effective 01/01/2025) https://www.cms.gov/files/document/draft-oasis-e1-manual-04-28-2024.pdf
//   OASIS-E2 (Effective 04/01/2026) https://www.cms.gov/files/document/oasis-e2-draft-508-11-14-25.pdf
//
// It found considerably more wrong than the three therapy items already demoted:
//   - FIVE item numbers appear in NO manual at all: M1020, M1300, M1350, M1900,
//     M2110. Primary Diagnosis is M1021 (M1023 is Other Diagnoses); Prior
//     Functioning is GG0100.
//   - FOUR were real but are retired from the current instrument: M1030, M1242,
//     M1730 ("Depression Screening — Removed"), M1910 ("Falls Risk Assessment
//     — Removed"). Depression is now D0150/D0160; falls are J1800/J1900; pain
//     is J0510/J0520/J0530.
//   - M2200 (Therapy Need) was removed per CMS-1780-F, confirming the earlier
//     demotion.
//   - M0069 was "Gender", NOT "Prognosis" as PennSync labelled it, and is
//     replaced by A0810 Sex in OASIS-E2. Wrong meaning AND retired.
//
// THREE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS, DELIBERATELY SEPARATE
//   source_verified_*        — FACTUAL: does this item number exist in the
//                              current CMS manual, and what is its title?
//                              A lookup. DONE (2026-09-01).
//   classification_signed_*  — Is the LEVEL below (verified / retired /
//                              not_a_cms_item / …) the right one, given that
//                              source check? A determination that follows from
//                              the evidence. SIGNED OFF — see below.
//   reviewed_by/at           — CLINICAL: is PennSync's *use* of this item
//                              appropriate, and is an abbreviated response set
//                              safe as a screening prompt? A judgement about
//                              patient care. NOT done, and not mine to make.
//
// WHO MAY WRITE THE THIRD ONE
// `reviewed_by` means a NAMED HUMAN confirmed this. An automated check must
// never write to it — doing so would make the product assert something untrue
// to a future auditor, the exact failure this layer exists to prevent. It is
// written only when a person actually signs off, and `review_source` records
// what their sign-off did and did not cover, so the record is never read as
// broader than the review behind it.
//
// Signed 2026-09-01 by Kevin Deyarmin. `review_source` states plainly that
// RESPONSE OPTIONS were not individually verified against the CMS manual — the
// known gap inside the attestation.
//
// RESPONSE-SET READ (2026-09-01) — WHAT IT FOUND
// The sign-off above states plainly that RESPONSE OPTIONS were not individually
// verified. That caveat has since been closed, and it turned out to be carrying
// most of the weight.
//
// The guidance manual states response codes as prose coding instructions rather
// than a parseable list, which is why the first check stopped at titles. CMS
// publishes the response sets separately, in the OASIS-E2 All Items instrument
// (12/11/2025). Every PennSync item present there was read against it option by
// option — code set, code order, and the MEANING of each option's text.
//
// Of the 24 items with an official response set to compare against:
//   -  1 reproduces it faithfully (M1800).
//   -  5 use the same codes in the same order with looser wording (M1700,
//      M1810, M1820, M1845, M1850).
//   - 18 have at least one code that means something DIFFERENT on the official
//      assessment, or a different answer shape entirely.
//
// A matching code SET is not a matching response set, and that is the trap this
// read exists to close. M1340's codes are {0,1,2} exactly as CMS has them — and
// PennSync's 2 is "Yes, infected" where the CMS 2 is "known but not observable".
// M2020's codes 1 and 2 are transposed against CMS. M2010's 0 means "not
// applicable" where the CMS 0 means "No, education was not provided". M1860's
// scale is offset by one from code 1 onward. A nurse reading a code off a
// PennSync screen and typing it into the same-numbered item in the EMR would
// enter the wrong response in each of those cases.
//
// WHAT WAS DELIBERATELY NOT DONE
// The option lists were NOT rewritten to the CMS wording. Stored assessments key
// off these values, and re-labelling code 2 of M2020 would silently change the
// meaning of every M2020 answer already recorded — changing clinician-entered
// facts after the fact. The divergence is instead recorded as data
// (`response_set`), and `mayCarryResponseToEmr()` makes the consequence
// deterministic. `oasisScales.js` and `oasisScoringEngine.js` mirror these same
// scales, so the app remains internally consistent with itself; what it is not
// is a reproduction of the CMS instrument.
//
// This does not overturn the clinical sign-off, it bounds it. Signing that an
// option list is usable as a SCREENING PROMPT is a different claim from saying
// it is the CMS response set, and only the first was ever made.
//
// CLINICAL SIGN-OFF IS TRACKED, NOT ASSUMED
// A classification is only as good as the person who made it. Every entry
// therefore carries its own review provenance:
//
//   reviewed_by     — who confirmed it ("" = nobody yet)
//   reviewed_at     — when (ISO date, "" = never)
//   review_source   — what authoritative document was checked against
//
// An entry with no `reviewed_by` has been CLASSIFIED but not SIGNED OFF, and
// `pendingClinicalReview()` lists exactly those. This matters because the
// classifications shipped in this file were derived from internal evidence (the
// repository contradicting itself on M2102, PDGM discontinuing M2200) and from
// the app's own canonical scale table — not from a qualified OASIS reviewer
// reading the CMS instrument. Until one does, the product must be able to say
// so, and `buildClinicalReviewWorksheet()` produces the artifact they need.
