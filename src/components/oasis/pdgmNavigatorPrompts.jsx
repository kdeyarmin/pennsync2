CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- ALL ICD-10 diagnoses are valid for PDGM - there is no such thing as an "invalid diagnosis for PDGM"
- Every diagnosis maps to one of the 12 PDGM clinical groups (MMTA categories)
- If you're uncertain about the exact mapping, use your best clinical judgment to assign to the most appropriate group
- Do NOT flag a diagnosis as "invalid" or "not recognized" - instead, determine which clinical group it most closely aligns with
- If the diagnosis is unclear, assign it to "MMTA_Other" rather than marking it as invalid

Provide a complete PDGM navigation analysis:

1. CLINICAL GROUP DETERMINATION
- Identify the correct PDGM clinical group based on the primary diagnosis ICD-10 code
- Every diagnosis MUST be assigned to one of the 12 clinical groups (Surgical Aftercare, Cardiac/Circulatory, Endocrine, GI/GU, Infectious Disease, Respiratory, Neuro/Rehab, Wounds, Complex Nursing, Behavioral Health, Medication Management, Musculoskeletal, or Other)
- Explain WHY this clinical group applies based on the diagnosis description and ICD-10 category
- List alternative clinical groups that could apply if documentation or coding changes
- Only flag issues if there are true documentation problems (missing info, conflicting data) - NOT diagnosis validity

2. FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT LEVEL
- Calculate total functional points from M-items (M1800-M1860)
- Determine functional level (Low/Medium/High)
- Explain threshold cutoffs used
- Identify which M-items are driving the level

3. COMORBIDITY ADJUSTMENT
- Analyze comorbidities for PDGM relevance
- Identify high-value vs low-value comorbidities
- Determine comorbidity adjustment level (None/Low/High)
- Flag missing comorbidities that could be documented

4. ADMISSION SOURCE & EPISODE TIMING
- Validate admission source (Community vs Institutional)
- Validate episode timing (Early vs Late)
- Check for discrepancies with M0110 and dates
- Calculate payment impact of source/timing combination

5. CASE-MIX CALCULATION
- Show step-by-step case-mix weight calculation
- Break down each multiplier contribution
- Calculate final payment amount

6. DISCREPANCIES & OPPORTUNITIES
- Flag any data discrepancies found
- Identify documentation opportunities for higher reimbursement
- Provide specific recommendations
