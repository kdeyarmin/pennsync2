// ADMIN-ONLY: documentation-gap patterns joined to closed-episode revenue.
//
// WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE MODULE FROM THE ENGINE
// `documentationGaps.js` has no concept of money and is what clinicians see.
// This module is where payment enters, and it is deliberately reachable only
// from an administrator surface (`canViewFinancials`) and only for CLOSED
// episodes.
//
// The closed-episode rule is the substantive constraint, not a technicality.
// "Across last quarter, ambulation was our most common note-versus-code
// mismatch, and those episodes grouped below cohort" is management information:
// it tells an administrator where documentation training is worth buying. "This
// open assessment would pay $340 more if M1860 were a 3" is a target attached
// to a specific patient and a specific nurse who is about to attest to it, and
// this module cannot produce that sentence because it will not accept an open
// episode.
//
// So there is no per-assessment uplift figure here, by construction. The output
// is counts, rates and cohort aggregates.
//
// Pure functions. No React, no SDK.
