OASIS DATA CONTEXT:
${JSON.stringify(narrativeContext, null, 2)}

Perform a comprehensive documentation quality analysis:

1. NARRATIVE ANALYSIS: For each functional score (M1800-M1860), analyze whether the supporting narrative:
   - Provides specific, measurable descriptions
   - Explains WHY the patient needs the level of assistance scored
   - Includes safety concerns and clinical rationale
   - Is consistent with the numeric score assigned

2. DIAGNOSIS-NARRATIVE ALIGNMENT: Check if narratives support:
   - The primary diagnosis and its manifestations
   - Comorbidities and their impact on function
   - Skilled care necessity

3. DOCUMENTATION GAPS: Identify missing elements that could:
   - Lead to claim denials
   - Trigger audit findings
   - Reduce PDGM payment
   - Create compliance risk

4. IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS: Provide specific, actionable suggestions for each gap
