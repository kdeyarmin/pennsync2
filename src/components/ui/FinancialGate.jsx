/**
 * FinancialGate — renders its children only for users allowed to see financial
 * data (see canViewFinancials). It is FAIL-CLOSED: while the current user is
 * still loading, and for every non-admin (e.g. a nurse/clinician), nothing
 * financial is rendered.
 *
 * Use this to wrap revenue / PDGM-payment / reimbursement / billing UI that
 * lives on NURSE-VISIBLE surfaces (e.g. the OASIS Analyzer's "Analyze" tab) so
 * clinical staff never see dollar figures. It reads the shared ['currentUser']
 * query that the app already caches app-wide, so wrapping many blocks is cheap
 * (React Query dedupes by key).
 *
 *   <FinancialGate>
 *     <RevenueCard ... />
 *   </FinancialGate>
 *
 * Pass `fallback` to render a placeholder for non-financial users; the default
 * is to render nothing.
 *
 * NOTE: this is a client-side visibility control for UX. For sensitive data the
 * server (Base44 functions / RLS) remains the real boundary — see canViewFinancials.
