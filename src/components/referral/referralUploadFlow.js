/**
 * Orchestrates one referral document upload, as plain data in / result out.
 *
 * The Referral Intake upload handler used to run validation, the upload, and the
 * AI quick scan inside a single `try` with a single `catch` that reported every
 * failure as "Failed to upload file. Please try again." That message was wrong
 * for the most common failure by far: the file uploads fine and the *AI
 * pre-fill* fails (LLM timeout on a long scanned fax, rate limit, credit limit).
 * The user then re-uploaded the same file, it uploaded fine again, the scan
 * failed again, and the message never changed.
 *
 * The three stages fail for different reasons and need different handling, so
 * they are separated here:
 *   - `validate` — the file itself is unusable; nothing was sent.
 *   - `upload`   — fatal; there is no document to attach to a referral.
 *   - `scan`     — NOT fatal; the document is stored and the user can type the
 *                  handful of intake fields themselves. The full clinical
 *                  extraction runs later, at processing time.
 *
 * Kept free of React and the Base44 SDK (the upload and scan calls are injected)
 * so it is unit-testable in isolation, matching referralUploadUtils.js and
 * referralExtraction.js.
