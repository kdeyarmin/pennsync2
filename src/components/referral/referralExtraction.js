/**
 * Single source of truth for referral document extraction.
 *
 * The app extracts referral data in two passes that previously duplicated their
 * prompts/schemas inline at the call sites:
 *   1. A quick categorization scan at upload time (ReferralIntake) for instant
 *      form pre-population, urgency triage, and suggested tasks.
 *   2. The full, OASIS-grade clinical extraction at processing time
 *      (ReferralPDFSummarizer).
 *
 * Both are defined here as plain data (prompt builders + JSON schemas, no React
 * and no Base44 SDK) so they can be unit-tested in isolation. The LLM call itself
 * is injected: callers pass the app's standardized `invokeLLM` helper
 * (src/lib/invokeLLM.js), which applies the shared timeout/retry policy, so a
 * transient failure no longer discards an extraction. Injection also keeps this
 * module free of `@/` imports so the colocated Node test resolves without Vite.

CRITICAL DOCUMENT READING INSTRUCTIONS:
- This document may contain BOTH typed text and HANDWRITTEN notes
- Read ALL text carefully, including handwritten annotations, checkboxes, signatures, and margin notes
- For handwritten content: interpret cursive, print, or mixed writing styles
- If handwriting is unclear, provide your best interpretation and flag with "[unclear handwriting]"
- Extract information from checkboxes, form fields, AND any written notes in margins or blank spaces
- Look for physician signatures, date stamps, and hand-marked priority indicators
- Pay special attention to:
  * Handwritten vital signs or assessment notes
  * Physician's handwritten orders or special instructions
  * Care notes written by hospital staff or case managers
  * Date/time stamps that may be handwritten
  * Contact information that may be partially handwritten

When you encounter handwritten text:
1. Transcribe it as accurately as possible
2. Include context about WHERE it appeared (e.g., "handwritten in margins", "noted in physician section")
3. If uncertain about legibility, include "[possibly X or Y]" notation

Analyze this patient referral document and extract ALL relevant information needed for:
1. **Complete OASIS-E assessment** (generate as many OASIS items as possible with confidence scores)
2. Admission nursing assessment
3. Care planning
4. **PDGM reimbursement optimization**

**YOUR PRIMARY GOAL: Generate a complete, Medicare-compliant OASIS assessment from the referral data. For each OASIS item, use the exact scoring scales and provide your confidence level (high/medium/low) and reasoning.**

**CRITICAL - PDGM DIAGNOSIS SELECTION:**
When determining primary and secondary diagnoses, you MUST optimize for maximum PDGM reimbursement by:
- Identifying the PDGM Clinical Group (MS-Rehab, Neuro/Rehab, Complex Nursing, etc.)
- Selecting the primary diagnosis that provides the highest case-mix weight
- Ensuring comorbidities are properly captured to increase case-mix adjustment
- Considering how functional impairment scores (OASIS M1800-M1860) interact with diagnosis selection
- If multiple diagnoses are present, prioritize those in higher-paying clinical groups
- Flag if additional clinical information is needed to optimize the PDGM group assignment

**PDGM Clinical Groups (highest to lowest reimbursement generally):**
1. MS-Rehab (Multiple Sclerosis, ALS, Parkinson's with rehab needs)
2. Neuro/Rehab (CVA, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord disorders)
3. Wounds/Surgical Aftercare (pressure ulcers, post-surgical wounds)
4. MMTA-NT-Surgical Rehab (joint replacement, fractures)
5. Behavioral Health (depression, anxiety as primary with ADL impact)
6. Complex Nursing (cancer care, diabetes with complications, heart failure)
7. MMTA - Cardiac/Circulatory (cardiac conditions, COPD)

**For each diagnosis extraction:**
- Note the ICD-10 code AND its PDGM clinical group
- If diagnosis could qualify for multiple groups, specify which is optimal
- Identify missing clinical details that could upgrade the PDGM group
- Flag if additional documentation is needed to support higher reimbursement

Extract comprehensive details organized by category. Be thorough and specific.

HANDWRITTEN NOTES HANDLING:
- If you find handwritten notes, include them in the appropriate section with context
- Create a special "handwritten_notes" field to capture any additional handwritten information that doesn't fit standard categories
- For illegible handwriting, note "[illegible handwriting - appears to be about X]"
- Cross-reference handwritten information with typed data to resolve conflicts or fill gaps

CONFIDENCE SCORING (REQUIRED):
- Populate "extraction_confidence" with an honest 0-100 score for EACH section.
- Base the score on how clearly the source supported it: clearly typed and explicit = high (85-100); partially documented or requiring inference = medium (60-84); handwritten, illegible, ambiguous, or largely absent = low (<60).
- Do NOT default everything to high. Calibrate so a reviewer can trust the numbers to triage what needs verification.
- List the specific fields you are least sure about in "extraction_confidence.low_confidence_fields".`;

Extract and categorize:

1. PATIENT INFORMATION:
- Patient full name
- Date of birth
- Contact information
- Address

2. REFERRAL DETAILS:
- Referral source (hospital, physician, facility name)
- Referral date
- Referring physician name and contact

3. CLINICAL CATEGORIZATION:
- Primary diagnosis
- Secondary diagnoses
- Category classification (cardiac, respiratory, wound_care, orthopedic, neurological, diabetes, post_surgical, general_medical, hospice, palliative)
- ICD-10 codes if mentioned
- Medical history highlights

4. URGENCY ASSESSMENT:
- Urgency indicators (urgent, high priority, stat, emergency, routine)
- Clinical urgency factors (recent hospitalization, unstable vitals, critical condition)
- Administrative urgency (insurance requirements, requested start date)
- Recommended priority level

5. INITIAL CARE NEEDS:
- Skilled nursing needs
- Therapy requirements (PT, OT, ST)
- Medical equipment needs (DME)
- Medication management requirements
- Wound care needs
- IV therapy requirements

6. SUGGESTED INITIAL TASKS:
- Critical actions needed immediately (within 24 hours)
- High priority actions (within 48-72 hours)
- Important follow-ups (within first week)
