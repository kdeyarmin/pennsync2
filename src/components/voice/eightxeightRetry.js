/**
 * eightxeightRetry — retry/backoff policy for outbound 8x8 API calls.
 *
 * Every outbound 8x8 path (sendSms, startMaskedCall, dispatchScheduledSms,
 * sendTestSms) makes a single bounded fetch to 8x8. A transient hiccup — a 429
 * rate-limit, a 502/503/504 from an 8x8 edge, or a dropped connection — would
 * otherwise fail the whole send and strand the patient, when a second attempt a
 * fraction of a second later would have gone through. This module is the
 * unit-tested source of truth for *whether* to retry and *how long* to wait
 * between attempts; the single-file backend functions keep an inline copy of
 * this policy (the Base44 deploy model forbids cross-file imports).
 *
 * Why retries are safe (no double-send): every send reuses the same
 * `clientMessageId`, which 8x8 treats as an idempotency key. A retried request
 * that the provider already accepted is de-duped rather than delivered twice, so
 * even retrying after an ambiguous network failure cannot text a patient twice.
 *
 * What is NOT retried: permanent client errors (400/401/403/404/422). Those
 * mean the request itself is wrong (bad number, bad credentials, opted-out) and
 * will fail identically on every attempt — retrying only wastes time and money.

 * Run `attemptFn` with bounded retries and backoff. `attemptFn(attempt)` is

 * fetch outcome: `{ ok, status, retryAfter? , ... }`. It may throw for a
 * transport-level failure (network/timeout); a thrown error is retried when
 * `isRetryableError` says so.
 *
 * Returns the final result with an added `attempts` count. A retryable failure
 * that exhausts the budget returns the last failing result (so the caller still
 * sees the real status/body); a non-retryable thrown error is re-thrown.
 *
 * `retryNetworkErrors` (default true) controls whether a *thrown* transport
 * failure is retried. Set it false for a non-idempotent operation such as voice
 * call origination — there a dropped connection might mean the call was already
 * placed, so a blind retry could double-dial. Retryable HTTP *statuses*
 * (where the server explicitly told us it failed) are always safe to retry.
 *
 * `sleep`/`now`/`rand` are injectable so the policy is fully unit-testable
 * without real timers or randomness.
