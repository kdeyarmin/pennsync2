Generate 3-5 care plans that address the patient's primary needs. Each care plan should follow this structure and be specific, measurable, and achievable.

Return a JSON array of care plans with this exact structure:
[
  {
    "problem": "Clear nursing diagnosis (e.g., 'Impaired mobility related to post-surgical status')",
    "goal": "Specific, measurable goal with timeframe (e.g., 'Patient will ambulate 50 feet with walker independently within 30 days')",
    "interventions": [
      "Specific nursing intervention 1",
      "Specific nursing intervention 2",
      "Specific nursing intervention 3"
    ],
    "frequency": "How often to assess (e.g., 'Each visit', 'Weekly', '3x per week')",
    "baseline_measurement": "Current state/measurement (e.g., 'Currently ambulates 20 feet with max assist')",
    "target_days": 30 or 60 or 90,
    "priority": "high|medium|low",
    "rationale": "Brief clinical rationale for this care plan"
  }
]

GUIDELINES:
- Address primary diagnosis and complications
- Include medication management if applicable
- Address functional limitations and ADL needs
- Include patient/caregiver education
- Consider safety issues (falls, infection, etc.)
- Avoid duplicating existing care plans
- Make goals SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- Use professional nursing language
- Prioritize based on clinical urgency and patient needs`;
