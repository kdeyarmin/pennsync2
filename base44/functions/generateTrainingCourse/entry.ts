RELIAS-STYLE COURSE DESIGN PRINCIPLES:

A. PRE-ASSESSMENT (test-out capability):
   - Generate ${Math.max(3, Math.round(question_count * 0.4))} pre-assessment questions covering the core learning objectives
   - Use only MCQ and true/false for pre-assessment (quick to complete)
   - Each question maps to a learning objective so the system can identify which modules to skip
   - If a learner scores 100% on pre-assessment, they can test out of the content and proceed directly to the post-test

B. MICROLEARNING SEGMENTS:
   - Each section should be a self-contained micro-segment completable in 3-5 minutes
   - Include a clear "estimated_minutes" per module
   - Break complex topics into bite-sized chunks — each section covers ONE concept
   - Staff should be able to pause after any section and resume later without losing context

C. REGULATORY CROSSWALK:
   - Map the course to specific CMS Conditions of Participation, OSHA standards, HIPAA requirements, or state regulations as applicable
   - Include the regulation code AND a plain-language explanation
   - The "regulation_ref" field in sections links specific content to specific regulations

D. COMPETENCY SKILLS:
   - Define 2-4 observable, measurable skills that a supervisor can validate after course completion
   - Each skill needs a validation method (direct observation, documentation review, verbal attestation, or return demonstration)
   - Skills should be specific enough that a supervisor knows exactly what to look for

E. BRAIN SPARKS (spaced retention):
   - Generate 6 retention questions to be delivered post-course at spaced intervals
   - Schedule: days 2, 4, 6 (first batch) and days 30, 32, 34 (second batch) — use day_offset field
   - Each BrainSpark focuses on the single most important concept from its linked module
   - Questions should be quick (MCQ only) and focused on safety-critical or commonly forgotten material
   - Include a brief rationale that reinforces the key concept

CONTENT CREATION RULES:

1. SECTIONS — Make every section rich and multi-dimensional:
   - "body": Core teaching content. Write as if explaining to a competent colleague who is new to this specific topic. Be concrete, not abstract.
   - "bullets": Reserve for lists of requirements, steps, or facts that benefit from scannable format.
   - "example": ALWAYS include a specific, named example. Not "a patient" but "Mrs. Johnson, a 78-year-old with CHF who lives alone." Make examples feel real.
   - "pro_tip": Include when you have genuine practical wisdom to share. These should feel like advice from a mentor.
   - "warning": Include ONLY for genuine safety/compliance risks. When included, be specific about what can go wrong.
   - "steps": Include when the section teaches a procedure or process. Number each step clearly.
   - "do_dont": Include when there are common mistakes worth contrasting. Keep to 2-4 items per side.
   - "mnemonic": Include only when genuinely helpful for recall. Don't force mnemonics.

2. CASE SCENARIOS — These are the most valuable learning tool:
   - Include "patient_context" with enough detail to feel like a real clinical encounter
   - The "challenge" should present a genuine dilemma, not an obvious choice
   - "what_could_go_wrong" should be specific and sobering — connect to real consequences (denied claims, patient harm, survey deficiencies)
   - "discussion_questions" should push higher-order thinking: "What would you do differently if..." or "How would this change if the patient also had..."

3. ASSESSMENT — Quality over quantity:
   - Scenario-based questions should present complete clinical vignettes (3-5 sentences of context)
   - MCQ distractors must be plausible — each wrong answer should represent a real mistake someone might make
   - "clinical_context" after each question connects the assessment back to why this matters in practice
   - Short answer rubrics must be specific: "Full credit requires mentioning X, Y, and Z. Partial credit if..."
   - At least ${Math.max(2, Math.round(question_count * 0.3))} questions should be at Apply/Analyze/Evaluate level

4. WRITING QUALITY:
   - Write for ${audienceLabel} in ${business_line === 'all' ? 'home health and hospice' : business_line} settings
   - Reading level: ${reading_level} (8th-10th grade)
   - Use "you" and "your" to address the learner directly
   - Prefer active voice and concrete language
   - When referencing regulations, explain what they mean in plain language
   - Avoid: jargon without definition, passive constructions, filler phrases, academic tone
   - Every section must pass the "So what?" test — the learner should understand why this matters to THEM`;
